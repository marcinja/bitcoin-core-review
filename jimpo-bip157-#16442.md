# General Notes

JAMES COMMENT:
  why not return true??

  see bluematt's comment: error is already logged in Pre-func
  no point in re-logging it. seems like this should be consistent though


RE not synchronizing net with filter:
  whatabout registering callbacks within the filter?

Rather than force the blockfilter-index thread to be synced with net. how about
treat "index-not-synced" to stop\_hash similarly to how we treat stop\_hash not
in chain active? (minus disconnecting from your peer)

 If block filters are setup, and the filter is synced the node will broadcast
 NODE\_COMPACT\_FILTER service bits.

 Agree with jamesob here. This code is bit unnecessary given that m\_synced is
 flipped to true only one time. Given that m\_synced is flipped only once, the
 corresponding bit in ServiceFlags should only be flipped once.

### (2)  cfc30957b227f1a6f01a0704815644bcfd998093
 Defines new protocol messages as described in BIP 157. Not much to say.
 Follows existing message definitions.

### (3) 7bbf08cbbad6add66250516666bc11d4d0a8d6dd
 Message handling for getcfilters
 seems good. checked against specification in BIP.

### (4) bc58d6984ea8c2169fad7f1b0ece9807b90152f
 Message handling for getcheaders
 seems good. checked against bip

### (5) 9da9daad6053934009448344bae77f4e18f36869
 message handling for getcfcheckpt

In PrepareBlockFilter request: (this applies to earlier commit; found out which)
  the log message should match the condition checked (unknown block filter,
  filter not synced yet, or filter not enabled)

### (6) bbb909cf12d11cb546fff2d47c02f93001ed5bdf
 Fix BlockFilter serde
 presumably this wasn't an issue before because the BlockFilter implementation
 only talked to itself. I'm guessing this is needed to match the btcd Neutrino
 serialization. The BIP ordering is the same as the top-to-bottom serde ordering
 in this commit so seems legit.

### (7) ab0ea72734ee0bcf7fdf8201d611941ea86ed15f
  Functional tests for cfilters p2p
  
why shadow node0 and node1?
  Lookup: what does add\_p2p\_connection return?

line 55: %s/nodes/blocks

line 83:
  we check if node0 shows signals the compact filter bit. Can't this be an NDF
  if block filter index is in its own thread? Or do we know that by giving the
  other node the full IBD, the blockfilter is necessarily synced somehow?

  should we use the syncwithvalidationinterfacequeue RPC here?

### (8) 77653ec568628291f69ea1b5a31bee35a6492a4a
  synchronize cfilter request handling with block filter index.

  yeah I don't really think we should be synchronizing net thread with the block
  filter. we should probably treat it as unknown hash (the filter index isn't
  aware ofthe blockhash)

  likewise for get cf checkpoint, we can safely just not serve requests that we
  know the block hash for, but when the index is not synced yet

  clients SHOULD ask many peers for messages anyway

### (9) f928bdd05fe218a3232994fd80ec792c82e2d214
  exercise cache update code during functional tests?
  should be the last commit...
  TODO: review this commit

### (10) 3499e8877b3be1a629647353ddb8bb380c10a513
  Cache compact filter checkpoints in memory
 
 looks good in general
